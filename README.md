# Shoppingcart - a microservice project
<b>Hello!</br>
This is my special project to implement almost everything that I learned from my recents Java Spring Boot courses. </br>
This project will be a little overdone because I really want to use as much as possible of the things that I have on my knowledge.</br>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
For this project is recommended to have the following technologies: </br>
</br>
<ul>
<li>JDK 11</li></br>
<li>Spring Tool Su√≠te 4</li></br>
<li>Postman</li></br>
<li>Zipkin</li></br>
</ul>
</br>
